# NeuralNetworks-DeepLearning
Module 21 Challenge

## Background:

The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, youâ€™ll use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Report:

### Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to create a binary classifier using a deep learning neural network to predict the success rate of applicants for funding from Alphabet Soup, a nonprofit organization. The provided dataset contains information on over 34,000 organizations, including metadata such as application type, affiliated sector of industry, government organization classification, use case for funding, income classification, funding amount requested, and whether the money was used effectively. The analysis involves preprocessing the dataset by dropping unnecessary columns, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and testing datasets. The neural network model is then designed, trained, and evaluated to determine its loss and accuracy. Finally, the model is optimized using various methods such as adjusting input data, adding more neurons and hidden layers, using different activation functions, and adjusting the number of epochs. The ultimate goal is to achieve a predictive accuracy higher than 75% and save the optimized model as an HDF5 file.

## Results:

### Data Preprocessing

* The column named "IS_SUCCESSFUL" is the target of this model (dependent variable).  If true, the money was used effectively.
* The features of this model are the NAME, APPLICATION, TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, INCOME_AMT,SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, STATUS, and ASK_AMT 
* For all optimization attempts "EIN" variable was removed as the data is neither a Target or a Feature.
* Different variables were excluded in the various optimization models - "STATUS", "SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS", "NAME"

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model  
### original model
*	How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

2 hidden layers were used in the original model of 80 and 30 neurons respectively.  Activation function of "ReLU" were used for both.  The outer layer activatuon was "Sigmoid".  100 Epochs were used to train the model.

*	Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

No, the result was 72.6%

### Optimization model 1
*	What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?

In my first optimization model, I tried adding another hidden layer and increasing the nodes to 100, 30 and 10.  Activation of "ReLU" was used on the first layer and the "Sigmoid" on the 2nd & 3rd layer.

* Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
No, the result was 72.5%

### Optimization model 2
*	What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?

I dropped 'SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS' column along with 'EIN' and 'NAME'.

I changed the 'APPLICATION_TYPE' cut-off from 500 to 700.

In my second optimization model, I changed the nodes to 100, 60 and 20.  Activation of "ReLU" on the first and second layer and "Sigmoid" 3rd.

* Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

No, the result was 72.6%

### Optimization model 3
*	What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?

I dropped 'SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS' 'EIN' and 'STATUS' columns.

I chose a cut-off value for 'NAME' of 4 which reduced the number of records to 475.

In my third optimization model, I changed the nodes to 25, 15 and 3.  Activation of "ReLU" on the first layer and "Sigmoid" on the second and third.

* Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

Yes, the result was 79.4%
